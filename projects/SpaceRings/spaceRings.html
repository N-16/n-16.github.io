                        <p>Space Rings is a 3D endless runner game in which the player controls a spaceship, and in order to keep it charged/moving, the player has to drive it through the rings that are placed at certain intervals. There are also two types of obstacles placed in between rings which makes it difficult for the player to follow the rings.</p>
